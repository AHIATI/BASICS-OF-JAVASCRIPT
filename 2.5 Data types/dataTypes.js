/* there are eight data types in js
number for any type of number
bigInt for large numbers
string for strings or single characters
boolean, null for null variables and undefined and symbol the undefined is when a variable is declared but not assigned

  With string we can three types of quotes that is the single quotes, double quotes and back tick single quotes
 Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example: */
  

 let name = "Ahiati";
 let x = 5;
 alert(x++);
 alert(x);

 alert(`Hello ${name}`);
 alert( `hello ${"name"}`);
 alert (`Hello ${1}`);
